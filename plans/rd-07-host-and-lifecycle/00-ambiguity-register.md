### Resolution Notes

**AR-1:** Factory `createHost(options): Host`. The returned `Host` is a stateful object exposing the lifecycle + draw surface. Chosen for consistency with the engine's existing `create*` factories for stateful seams (`createDecoderState`, `createKeymap`).

**AR-2:** Typed callback options passed to `createHost`: `onInput(e: InputEvent)`, `onResize(e: ResizeEvent)`, `onSuspend()`, `onResume()`. Preserves the discriminated-union type-safety the engine relies on and is trivial to drive headlessly in tests. EventEmitter rejected (stringly-typed, listener-leak prone).

**AR-3:** `host.render(next: ScreenBuffer): void` holds the previous frame, calls `serialize(next, prev, { caps })`, performs the single coalesced write, then stores `next` as the new previous. The app never touches `serialize` or the stream directly.

**AR-4:** Per-platform abstraction (`linux | darwin | win32`) with the Windows code paths implemented now (VT enable, `stdout 'resize'`, `SIGBREAK`). POSIX paths fully tested locally; Windows *acceptance/verification* is deferred-to-Windows-runner, mirroring RD-01's deferred-to-remote CI cells. Roadmap advances to ✅ Implemented on POSIX-green; 🔒 Verified awaits the Windows runner.

**AR-5:** 8-file responsibility split under `src/engine/host/`: `types.ts`, `host.ts` (createHost orchestrator), `modes.ts` (enter/leave escape sequences driven by caps), `signals.ts` (signal install/teardown), `streams.ts` (binding, isTTY, `/dev/tty`), `platform.ts` (per-OS abstraction), `restore.ts` (guaranteed/panic restore), `index.ts` (barrel). Keeps every file single-responsibility and within the 200–500 line target.

**AR-6:** Host owns `process.exit()` on the signal/crash paths because guaranteed restore-on-all-paths (AC-2) requires it. Exit codes: SIGINT→130, SIGTERM→143, SIGHUP→129, uncaughtException→1, normal→0. `exitOnSignal?: boolean` (default `true`) opts out; `onBeforeExit(code)` hook lets apps flush state before exit. On uncaughtException the host also prints the error to stderr before exiting 1.

**AR-7:** `ResizeEvent { readonly type: 'resize'; readonly columns: number; readonly rows: number }` defined in `host/types.ts`. It is delivered via SIGWINCH / stdout `'resize'`, not decoded from bytes, so it stays out of RD-06's pure `InputEvent` union and the input module is untouched.

**AR-8:** `start(): Promise<void>` and `stop(): Promise<void>`, both idempotent (double-start/double-stop are safe no-ops). Async to permit an async `/dev/tty` bind. `stop()` performs teardown + restore (cooked mode, main screen, cursor visible, mouse/paste/focus off) but never calls `process.exit` — exit is owned by the signal/error paths (AR-6).

**AR-9:** Resize coalescing via a pending-flag + a single `setImmediate`: the first SIGWINCH / stdout `'resize'` schedules one immediate callback that reads `out.columns`/`out.rows` once and emits a single `ResizeEvent`, then clears the flag. Deterministic and timer-free (no fake clock in tests). A debounce timer can be added later if real terminals prove chatty across ticks.

**AR-10:** On `SIGCONT` the host re-asserts modes (raw, alt-screen, mouse, paste, focus, keyboard per caps), re-serializes its stored last buffer against `null` (forcing a full repaint) and writes it, then calls `onResume()`. On `SIGTSTP` it fires `onSuspend()`, restores the terminal (cooked/main-screen/cursor), then re-raises the stop with default disposition (`SIGSTOP`) to actually suspend. Works with zero app cooperation.

**AR-11:** In non-TTY mode `start()` skips raw mode + alt-screen + mode setup and sets `isTTY:false`, but `render()` still serializes and writes frames to the bound output stream (no alt-screen framing). The host never swallows frames; the *degradation policy* (whether to run at all) is RD-08's essentials gate, which reads the host-exposed `isTTY`.

**AR-12:** Merged into AR-6 — on `uncaughtException` the host restores, prints the error to stderr, and exits 1. The *registration* of that handler is part of the AR-17 panic-restore set.

**AR-17:** One idempotent `restore()` (guarded so it runs at most once) is wired to: the signal handlers (SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP/SIGTSTP/SIGCONT), `process.on('uncaughtException')`, `process.on('unhandledRejection')`, and a synchronous `process.on('exit')` last-resort restore (sync fd writes only). The `'exit'` backstop catches any path that bypassed `stop()`, including a synchronous crash mid-setup (AC-8 panic test).

**AR-13:** Test by **designing for injection, not mocking**. All OS effects (`setRawMode`, signal subscription, `exit`, the synchronous process-`exit` backstop, the resize source, the timer source, and the bound input/output streams) sit behind one injectable **runtime adapter** that defaults to the real Node bindings. In-process spec/impl tests inject a fake adapter that records `exit(code)` (instead of killing the runner) and a capturing output stream that collects the exact ANSI — deterministic, no real signals/timers. A small **explicit subprocess e2e** (`host-signals.e2e.test.ts`, run like `install.e2e.test.ts`) spawns a real host, sends a real `SIGINT`, and asserts the real `child.exitCode` (130) plus the leave-mode sequences in captured output — the only honest proof of AC-2/AC-8. `node-pty` rejected (native build-step dev dep, fragile on the 3-OS × Node-18/20/22 matrix, against the zero-native stance); mock-only rejected (cannot prove real exit codes / the real `'exit'` backstop). **Refinement to AR-5:** the injectable runtime adapter is the concrete shape of `platform.ts` — `platform.ts` exports the real adapter (per-OS signal set, VT enable, resize source) implementing an adapter interface declared in `types.ts`; tests pass a fake implementing the same interface. No new file beyond the AR-5 layout.

**AR-14:** The host owns the ESC disambiguation timer. After a `decode()` whose resulting `state.carry` is a lone trailing ESC, the host arms a `ESC_TIMEOUT_MS` (50ms) timer via the injectable timer source; arriving bytes cancel it, otherwise it fires `flush(state)` and dispatches the Escape key. Keeps `decode()`/`flush()` pure (RD-06) and the timer deterministic in tests.

**AR-15:** Keymap naming is out of host scope. The host delivers raw `InputEvent`s through `onInput`; the app layers `createKeymap` on top. Matches RD-07's "Won't Have" (input decoding/naming belongs to RD-06); the host only wires bytes→`decode`→dispatch.

**AR-16:** The host attaches an `'error'` listener to the bound output stream. On `EPIPE` it runs the idempotent `restore()` best-effort (wrapped so secondary write failures are swallowed), calls `onBeforeExit(0)`, and exits 0 — a pipe disconnect is an expected end, not a crash — with no unhandled rejection. Other write errors fall through to the uncaughtException path (AR-6).

## Gate Confirmation

All 17 items carry the user's explicit decision. Zero deferred. The user gave the final
confirmation — "I have reviewed and confirmed all 17 items" (2026-06-27) — so the gate is open
and the remaining plan documents may be written.

## Runtime Decisions (discovered during exec_plan)

> Decisions made while executing that were not covered by the planning gate. Tagged `(runtime)`.

**RT-1 (runtime) — Keyboard protocol (modes table step 9) is deferred.** During Phase 2 it
surfaced that enabling the Kitty keyboard protocol (`CSI >…u`) or `modifyOtherKeys` (`CSI >4;…m`)
makes a capable terminal emit CSI-u key encodings that **RD-06's decoder cannot yet parse** —
that decoding is `DEF-1`, deferred to Phase B (`plans/00-roadmap.md`). Enabling step 9 now would
therefore *break* keys on exactly the terminals where caps detect support, and the plan never
pinned the flag values (`…`). **Decision (user, 2026-06-27): defer step 9.** `enterMode`/`leaveMode`
implement steps 1–8 only and emit **no** keyboard-protocol bytes, regardless of
`caps.keyboard.kittyFlags`/`.modifyOtherKeys`. The spec tests (ST-1/1b/2) do not exercise keyboard
caps, so they are unaffected. Tracked as **DEF-2** below; revisit when RD-06 Phase B lands CSI-u
decoding (the gating is already present in caps, so it is a one-line re-enable).

## Deferrals (DEF)

| #  | Deferral | Reason | Revisit |
|----|----------|--------|---------|
| DEF-2 | Keyboard-protocol enable (modes step 9: Kitty `CSI >…u` / `modifyOtherKeys` `CSI >4;…m`) | RD-06 cannot decode CSI-u key encodings yet (RD-06 DEF-1) | RD-06 Phase B (CSI-u/Kitty decode) |
